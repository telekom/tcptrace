Special thanks to the following organizations:

    The National Science Foundation
	For funding the rebirth of tcptrace which has made it possible
	to hire students and purchase computers for cross-platform
	development 

    Sun Microsystems
	For donating the web server and Solaris development platform
        that serves as www.tcptrace.org

		on the tool (and drew the nice web page graphic)
	 Tim Shepard 
		for writing xplot, of course, providing
	      	a wonderful tool for understanding TCP
	 Bill Fenner (fenner@parc.xerox.com)
		pointed out a couple small bugs in version 3.2.1
		pointed out a bug in 3.2.5 that kept it from reading
			any packets on a PC (endian bug)
	 Jeff Semke (semke@psc.edu)
		sent me diffs to get it compile under
			"NetBSD 1.2 on a Pentium box."
	 Rick Jones (raj@hpisrdq.cup.hp.com)

	        autoconf and making the Darwin/OSX port possible
