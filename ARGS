In Use Options

  -AN     Average N segments for throughput graphs, default is 10
  -BN     first segment number to analyze (default 1)
  -C      produce color plot[s]
  -D      print in decimal
  -EN     last segment number to analyze (default last in file)
  -F      create segsize graph[s]
  -G	  create ALL graphs
  -M      produce monochrome (b/w) plot[s]
  -N      create cwin graph[s] (data on _N_etwork)
  -Ofile  dump matched packets to tcpdump file 'file'
  -P      print packet contents for selected connections
  -R      create rtt sample graph[s]
  -S      create time sequence graph[s]
  -T      create throughput graph[s], (average over 10 segments, see -A)
  -W      report on estimated congestion window (not generally useful)
  -X      print in hexidecimal
  -Z      dump raw rtt sample times to file[s]

  -b      brief output format
  -c      ignore non-complete connections (didn't see syn's and fin's)
  -d      whistle while you work (enable debug, use -d -d for more output)
  -e      extract contents of each TCP stream into file
  -fEXPR  output filtering (see -hfilter)
  -h      print help messages
  -iN     ignore connection N (can use multiple times)
  -l      long output format
  -n      don't resolve host or service names (much faster)
  -oN     only connection N (can use multiple times)
  -p      print all packet contents (can be very long)
  -q      no output (if you just want modules output)
  -r      print rtt statistics (slower for large files)
  -s      use short names (list \"picard.cs.ohiou.edu\" as just \"picard\")
  -t      'tick' off the packet numbers as a progress indication
  -u      print minimal UDP information too
  -v      print version information and exit
  -w      print various warning messages
  -xMODULE_SPECIFIC
  -y      omit the (yellow) instantaneous throughput points in tput graph
  -z      zero axis options
