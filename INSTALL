OK, to the best of my knowledge, you should be able to get tcptrace to
compile and run under:

Solaris
NetBSD
FreeBSD
Linux
Tru64
Darwin/OSX


Step 1: Get pcap library
  If you want to be able to read tcpdump format files, then you'll
  need to have already installed the pcap library (see README.pcap).
  If tcpdump was installed correctly, then you're probably all set.
  If you don't HAVE this package and don't CARE about it, then comment
  "GROK_TCPDUMP" out of Makefile.in and we'll just skip it in the
  compilation. 

Step 2: run "./configure"
  that should build a Makefile that'll work on your machine

Step 3: Edit Makefile
  Only necessary if you want to change the file formats supported,
  the modules compiled in, compiler flags, etc (it's commented)

Step 4: run "make"
  that should create tcptrace

Step 5: Install
  The program doesn't need to be setuid or anything, so once you get
  the "tcptrace" binary, just stuff it wherever you keep such things
  and you're all set.
  "make install" will put it in /usr/local/bin by default
