 *
 * Previous versions of tcptrace were released under a license that
 * was much less restrictive with respect to how tcptrace could be
 * used in commercial products.  Because of this, I am willing to
 * consider alternate license arrangements as allowed in Section 10 of
 * the GNU GPL.  Before I would consider licensing tcptrace under an
 * alternate agreement with a particular individual or company,
 * however, I would have to be convinced that such an alternative
 * would be to the greater benefit of the networking community.
